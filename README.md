## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The Anaconda distribution of Python 3.xx should be enough to run the code posted this repository.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
First, as I plan my big family vacation to Hawaii, I was interested in 
1. What is the most popular neighborhood for a big family vacation with Airbnb in Hawaii?
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit the top 10 popular neighborhoods? By how much do prices spike?

Then, I wanted to expand the perspective of looking at this Airbnb data as I was also curious about the factors affecting the Airbnb prices and if we could predict the prices for listing. To answer these questions, I developed predictive models for price and analyzed the important factors in the price of listings. This would be beneficial for potential Airbnb hosts who plan to launch their new accommodation in Hawaii to help set competitive prices.

3. How to set the price for a new Airbnb property as a new host? What factors affect Airbnb prices in Hawaii?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are two notebook files and one `.py` file.  
- The part-1 notebook (`hawaii_airbnb_q1_q2_part1.ipynb`) includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) along with decriptive statistics regarding the question 1 and 2.  
- The part-2 notebook (`hawaii_airbnb_q3_part2.ipynb`) deals with the question 3 where data wrangling, EDA, machine learning model development, and post-analysis are performed.  
- `Airbnb_Price_ML.py` covers the functions for data pre-processing, feature selection + engineering, model training + testing, and feature importance analysis.


## Results<a name="results"></a>
The key findings obtained from the code can be found at the Medium post [here].
